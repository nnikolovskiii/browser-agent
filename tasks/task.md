## Task:
create an agent (like the way the below agent is created) that can do web actions using playwright.

## Answer:
Excellent question. Looking at the sophisticated structure of your file-based agent, the answer is:

**Yes, it is not only smart but also an ideal evolution of your current project.**

Your existing agent architecture is a perfect foundation for a web-based agent using Playwright. You've already solved many of the hard problems: state management, planning, tool execution loops, and structured output from LLMs. You're essentially just swapping the "environment" from a local file system to the World Wide Web.

Hereâ€™s a blueprint for how you could adapt your existing agent architecture to create a Playwright-based web agent, drawing parallels to your current code.

### Blueprint for Your Playwright Agent

#### 1. Create Your Playwright Toolset (The "Browser" Tools)

Just as you have `file_utils.py` and `llm_tools.py`, you'll create a `browser_tools.py`. This is the most critical new component. Instead of interacting with files, these tools will interact with a browser page.

You'll need a way to manage the Playwright session. A simple approach is to have a singleton or a global object that your tools can access.

**`agent/tools/browser_tools.py` (New File):**

```python
import playwright.sync_api
from langchain_core.tools import tool

# --- Playwright Session Management ---
# This object will hold our browser instance so it persists across tool calls.
class BrowserSession:
    def __init__(self):
        self._playwright = None
        self.browser = None
        self.page = None

    def start(self):
        if not self.page:
            self._playwright = playwright.sync_api.sync_playwright().start()
            self.browser = self._playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False) # Start in non-headless to see it work
            self.page = self.browser.new_page()

    def close(self):
        if self.page:
            self.page.close()
        if self.browser:
            self.browser.close()
        if self._playwright:
            self._playwright.stop()

# Create a single instance to be used by all tools
browser_session = BrowserSession()
browser_session.start() # You might manage this start/stop elsewhere


# --- Browser Tools ---

@tool
def goto_url(url: str) -> str:
    """Navigates the browser to a specified URL."""
    try:
        browser_session.page.goto(url, timeout=60000)
        return f"Successfully navigated to {url}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error navigating to {url}: {e}"

@tool
def click_element(selector: str, description: str) -> str:
    """Clicks on a web element found by a CSS selector."""
    """Use this to click on buttons, links, or other interactive elements.
    The 'description' should be a brief text explaining what you are clicking on, for example 'the login button'."""
    try:
        browser_session.page.locator(selector).click()
        return f"Successfully clicked on element with selector '{selector}'."
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error clicking element '{selector}': {e}"

@tool
def fill_text(selector: str, text: str) -> str:
    """Fills a text input field with the given text."""
    """Use this for login forms, search bars, etc."""
    try:
        browser_session.page.locator(selector).fill(text)
        return f"Successfully filled '{text}' into element '{selector}'."
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error filling element '{selector}': {e}"

@tool
def get_page_content() -> str:
    """Returns the text content (DOM) of the current web page."""
    """Use this to 'see' the current state of the page and decide the next action."""
    try:
        # A more advanced version would clean this HTML or extract key info
        return browser_session.page.content()
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error getting page content: {e}"

# Bind these tools for the LLM, just like you did in llm_tools.py
web_tools = [goto_url, click_element, fill_text, get_page_content]
web_tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in web_tools}

# You would then bind these to your LLM
# llm_with_web_tools = kimi_llm.bind_tools(web_tools)

```

#### 2. Adapt Your Agent's State (`core/state.py`)

Your `State` currently tracks file-system-related information. You'll need to adapt it for a web context.

**Modified `agent/core/state.py`:**

```python
class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    user_task: str
    # --- New/Modified State Fields ---
    current_url: str          # To track the browser's current location
    page_content: str         # The "context" is now the content of the webpage
    plan: str                 # Re-use your planning mechanism
    steps: List[Step]         # Re-use your step segmentation
    current_step_index: int   # Re-use step tracking
    # ... any other fields you need
```
You would remove `project_path`, `context`, `project_structure` etc., or keep them if you want a hybrid agent that can work on both files and the web.

#### 3. Redesign the Agent's "Senses" and Prompting

Your current agent's "senses" are `llm_file_explore` and the context built from files. The web agent's "senses" will be the `get_page_content` tool.

The core loop will be:
1.  **Look:** Call `get_page_content` to update the state.
2.  **Think:** The LLM looks at `page_content` and the `user_task` to decide the next action (`click`, `fill`, etc.).
3.  **Act:** The `tool_node` executes the chosen web tool.
4.  Repeat.

You'll need to modify your main agent prompt (`agent_instruction` in `prompts/prompts.py`).

**Modified `agent_instruction`:**

```python
agent_instruction = """You are a capable web browsing assistant. Your goal is to complete the user's task by navigating and interacting with websites.

You have access to a set of tools to control a web browser. After every action, the page content will be updated. Analyze the page content to decide your next step.

# User Task:
{user_task}

# Current URL:
{current_url}

# Current Page Content (HTML):
{page_content}

# Plan:
{plan}

# Current step to execute:
{current_step}

# Action history for this step:
{action_history}

Based on the above, decide which tool to use next to progress on the current step.
"""
```

#### 4. Wire It Up in LangGraph (`core/configs.py`)

Your existing graph structure is almost perfect for this. The `explore_plan_action` is a robust pattern.

*   The initial nodes (`llm_file_explore`, `llm_call_evaluator`, `build_context`) would be replaced. The "context building" is now simpler: it's just calling `goto_url` with an initial URL or a search engine URL, and then `get_page_content`.
*   The main action loop (`llm_call` -> `should_continue` -> `environment` -> `llm_call`) remains conceptually the same. You just need to ensure it's using the new `web_tools_by_name` and the new `llm_with_web_tools`.

### Key Challenges & Best Practices

1.  **"Seeing" the Page**: The raw HTML from `page.content()` can be massive and noisy for an LLM. Consider pre-processing it:
    *   Use `BeautifulSoup` to strip out `<script>`, `<style>` tags and get only the `body`'s text.
    *   **Advanced:** Assign a unique ID (e.g., `data-ai-id="1"`) to all interactive elements (`<a>`, `<button>`, `<input>`) on the page. Your prompt can then instruct the LLM to refer to elements by these simpler IDs (e.g., `click_element(selector='[data-ai-id="1"]')`). This is a very powerful technique used by state-of-the-art browser agents.

2.  **State Management**: The `BrowserSession` class above is a simple way to handle the non-serializable Playwright objects. Since LangGraph state is typically serialized between steps, you can't pass the `page` object directly in the `State` dictionary. A globally accessible session manager is a common and effective pattern.

3.  **Error Handling**: Web automation is brittle. Selectors change, pages load slowly. Your tools need robust `try...except` blocks, and your agent needs to be able to "recover" from an error (e.g., "The selector was not found, let me look at the page content again and find a new one.").

---

In conclusion, your current project is an excellent launchpad. By creating a new set of browser-focused tools and adapting your state and prompts, you can leverage your entire existing LangGraph planning and execution engine to build a very powerful web agent. It's a natural and highly valuable next step.
