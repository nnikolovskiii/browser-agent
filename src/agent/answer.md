The AI Task Agent project is a voice-first, AI-driven virtual assistant that automates task, project, and goal management. It acts like a personalized operating system, allowing users to manage their work through voice commands (with text as a fallback), eliminating the need for manual task management. The agent creates, updates, and deletes tasks automatically, stores relevant information, and organizes everything in a dedicated file system under `/home/nnikolovskii/info`. It uses natural-language understanding and learns user behavior to proactively manage tasks. Currently in testing, it runs in Docker containers and uses Telegram for voice input, with potential for future integrations like custom dashboards or other interfaces.
